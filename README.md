• Built a project where a crop dataset was trained on multiple models and the best model was then determined to make recommendations for the crop model
• After completion of fitting the data under various models found that the best model for this dataset is ’Naive Bayes’ with an accuracy ’0.955’ which shows this model is perfectly fit for the dataset
